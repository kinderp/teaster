repo-key dir is used in many Dockerfiles like below

RUN chmod 600 /repo-key \
    && echo "IdentityFile /repo-key" >> /etc/ssh/ssh_config \
    && echo "StrictHostKeyChecking no" >> /etc/ssh/ssh_config

See Dockerfile_consumer or Dockerfile_icelery for an example.

So it is expected that you create in this dir a ssh keys pair
and add pub key in your github repo to garantee write access
to all the containers that need it.
Below instructions on how to add a pub key in your git project

https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#deploy-keys

you can generate in repo-key dir your keys pair in this way:

ssh-keygen -q -t rsa -N '' -f repo-key

after that you shoud have two files:

- repo-key     (private key)
- repo-key.pub (public key)

Add repo-key.pub as explained in #deploy-keys above.
